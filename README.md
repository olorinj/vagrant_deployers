# vagrant_deployers
Configuration files to automate vagrant deploying of multiple technologies.

# Introduction
There are many options to create and/or use multiple tecnologies using virtual machines.
I would like to help the community creating Vagrant files to help on deploying different technologies to be used like if they were docker images.
Looking for a solution that may not force to use licensed software I decided to uset hese technologies:
* Hypervisor: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
* Deploying system: [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)

Some people may have a question: Why a configuration file? It isn't better to create vagrant boxes?
Well, I think it is better to use Vagrant files for deploying because it is the best way to check what is doing the provided file.
